I need to create an analysis describing a new functionality. The goal is to see occured transactions including withdrawal and deposit operations for all accounts of the chosen client. Optionally, from-date, to-date and account filters can be specified to reduce the amount of return data. I need two documents, one for testers and one for developers.

The response should contain a list of financial operations depending on the filter criteria and a summary:

the sum of all incoming money
the sum of all outgoing money
For test scenario, adjust default data so that some client has multiple accounts so that the feature can be properly tested. Generate also Gherkin test scenario descriptions.
For developers, include UML diagrams describing both the structure and data flow in the analysis.

Is there anything I have omitted or missed?
